# StockDataAnalysis
This is a Jupyter file that I made using Python. I have created several methods, and will provide documentation for all of them soon. Ultimately, it pulls data from finnhub, and then there are many methods to analyze and manipulate the data to your liking.

There is also a discord bot stored towards the bottom of the file that I have connected to a personal server.
